# What is Rong?

**Rong** (রং) is a command-line tool that generates **Material You-compatible color
palettes** from images and videos. It processes visual input and extracts color
values following the [Material Design 3 (Material You)](https://m3.material.io/)
specification.

This is useful for dynamically theming desktop environments, applications, or any
system that supports Material You or customizable color schemes.
